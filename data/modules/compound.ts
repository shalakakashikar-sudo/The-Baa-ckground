According to: The news is good according to the report.
Ahead of: The train arrived ahead of schedule.
Next to: Shadow sits next to the barn.
Due to: The grass is wet due to the rain.
Close to: Our farm is close to the house.

#### Common Three-Word Groups
In front of: Shadow stands in front of the gate.
In addition to: The sheep eats apples in addition to the grass.
On behalf of: I am speaking on behalf of Shadow.
By means of: He climbed the wall by means of a ladder.
As well as: The shepherd is here as well as the sheep.

#### Tip
Learn these as one single word. Do not try to translate each part separately.`
