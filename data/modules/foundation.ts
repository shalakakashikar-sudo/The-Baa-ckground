  content: `### What Are Prepositions?
Prepositions are words that show relationships between a noun/pronoun and other words in a sentence. They provide the "context" for your nouns and verbs.

#### The Sentence Glue
Without prepositions, English is just a list of disconnected names and actions. They answer questions like where?, when?, how?, and in what manner?
- Broken: Aayu sits the hill.
- Connected: Aayu sits on the hill.

#### The Simple Formula
Preposition + Object (noun/pronoun) = Prepositional Phrase
Example: [Aayu] ← [on] → [the hill]

#### The Four Main Roles
1. Place: Where is it? Aayu is in the barn.
2. Time: When is it? Aayu wakes up at noon.
3. Direction: Where is it moving? Aayu ran toward the gate.
4. Logic: Why/Whose is it? This gift is for Aayu.

#### The "GPS" Rule: In, On, at
To avoid confusion, use the "Pyramid Logic" to visualize how specific a word is:
- At (The Top): Specific points or precise addresses.
- On (The Middle): Surfaces, streets, or specific days.
- In (The Base): Enclosed spaces, cities, or long time periods.

#### The Rule of the Object
A preposition must be followed by a noun or a pronoun. This is called the Object of the Preposition.
Example: Aayu is looking at the gate. (Gate is the object)

> ⚠️ Pronoun Tip: Always use objective pronouns (me, him, her, us, them) after a preposition. It is always "between you and me," never "between you and I."

#### Preposition vs. Adverb
If a word looks like a preposition but has no object following it, it is actually an adverb.
- Preposition: Aayu fell down the stairs. (Object: the stairs)
- Adverb: Aayu fell down. (No object; it describes the fall itself.)`
