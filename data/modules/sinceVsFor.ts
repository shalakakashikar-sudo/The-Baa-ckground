Since and For are the tools we use to describe how long something has been happening. One measures distance, the other identifies a start.

#### 1. FOR (The Duration)
For is used when you are counting units of time. It tells you the total length of the journey.
- Minutes: Shadow waited for ten minutes.
- Days: It rained for three days.
- Months: We traveled for six months.
- General: I have been here for a long time.

#### 2. SINCE (The Starting Point)
Since is used when you name the exact moment the action began.
- Clock Time: Shadow has been waiting since 9:00 AM.
- Days: I have been hungry since Monday.
- Years: The farm has stood here since 2010.
- Actions: I have been happy since I arrived.

#### The Simple Test
- For: Measures how long (duration).
- Since: Points to when it started (start time).

Example: I waited for two hours.
Example: I have been waiting since noon.

> Tense Tip: Since is almost always used with perfect tenses (Have/Has + Been). You cannot say "I am here since Monday." English logic requires "I have been here since Monday."`
