A preposition never likes to be alone. It is the captain of a team called a Prepositional Phrase. This phrase always starts with a preposition and ends with a noun or pronoun, known as the object.

#### The Core Logic
A phrase is rarely just two words. Usually, there are descriptive words (modifiers) in the middle.
Structure: Preposition + Modifiers + Object

Example: Shadow is in the rusty, old box.

#### Reference: Single-Word Prepositions
about, above, across, after, against, along, among, around, as, at, before, behind, below, beneath, beside, between, beyond, by, despite, down, during, except, for, from, in, inside, into, like, near, of, off, on, onto, outside, over, past, since, through, throughout, to, toward, under, underneath, until, up, upon, with, within, without.

#### Common Compound Prepositions
according to, ahead of, apart from, as for, because of, by means of, due to, in addition to, in case of, in front of, in spite of, instead of, next to, on behalf of, out of, owing to, prior to, thanks to, up to, with regard to.

#### Ending Sentences
The "old rule" said never end a sentence with a preposition. Modern English logic says it is perfectly fine, especially in questions.
- Natural: What are you looking for?
- Formal: For what are you looking? (Avoid this unless writing a legal document).

#### Fronting for Emphasis
Sometimes we move the prepositional phrase to the very beginning to add focus to the location or time.
Example: Under the old oak tree, Shadow was hiding.`
