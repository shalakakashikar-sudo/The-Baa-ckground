These prepositions describe a change in state. They show movement from one type of space to another.

#### 1. INTO (Outside to Inside)
Into describes movement from an open area into a closed container or volume.
- Focus: Entering a 3D space.

Example: Shadow jumped into the pond.
Example: Step into the room.
Example: Put the bell into the box.

#### 2. ONTO (Low to High Surface)
Onto describes movement from a lower position onto a flat, 2D surface.
- Focus: Landing on a top surface.

Example: The sheep jumped onto the roof.
Example: Place the plate onto the table.
Example: Step onto the wet grass.

#### 3. OUT OF (Inside to Outside)
Out Of is the opposite of into. It shows exit from a 3D container.
- Focus: Leaving a 3D space.

Example: Shadow ran out of the barn.
Example: Take the wool out of the bag.
Example: Get out of the car.

> Static vs. Dynamic: Use In and On for staying in one place. Use Into and Onto for moving to a new place.

Example: Shadow is in the barn.
Example: Shadow ran into the barn.`
