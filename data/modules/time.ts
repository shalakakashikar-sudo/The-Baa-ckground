Time uses the same pyramid logic as place. We move from long, general periods down to exact, precise moments.

#### 1. IN (Long Periods)
Months, years, seasons, and centuries.
Example: Aayu was born in October.

#### 2. ON (Days and Dates)
Specific days and full calendar dates.
Example: Meet me on Monday.

#### 3. AT (Exact Moments)
Clock times and fixed points.
Example: The barn door opens at 3:00 PM.

#### By vs. Until vs. Before
- By (The Deadline): Action must be done at or before this time.
Example: Finish the shearing by Friday.
- Until (Continuation): Action continues up to this point and then stops.
Example: Aayu will sleep until noon.
- Before (Earlier): Any time prior to the point.
Example: Come before the movie starts.

#### During (The Period)
Used to show an action happening throughout a stretch of time.
Example: It rained during the night.

> ⚠️ The No-Preposition Rule: Do not use at, in, or on if the time word follows Next, Last, This, or Every.
Example: Aayu went home last night.`
