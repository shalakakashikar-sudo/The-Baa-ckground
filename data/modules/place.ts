  content: `### The Logic of Location
To understand location, imagine an inverted pyramid. We move from general, big areas at the top, down to specific, tiny points at the bottom.

#### 1. IN (The Container)
Think of IN as a 3D space. Cities, countries, rooms, and liquids.
- Logic: You are inside boundaries.
Example: Shadow lives in London.

#### 2. ON (The Surface)
Think of ON as a 2D line or flat surface. Contact with the top or side.
- Logic: Touching the surface.
Example: The cup is on the table.

#### 3. AT (The Specific Point)
Think of AT as a dot on a map. A landmark or functional spot.
- Logic: You are at a specific mark.
Example: Meet me at the bus stop.

#### Between vs. Among
- Between: Used for exactly TWO things, or specific distinct items.
Example: Shadow is between the two rocks.
- Among: Used for a general group of THREE or more.
Example: Shadow is among friends.

#### The Preposition House
- Over: Above the roof.
- Under: Below the foundation.
- Behind: At the back of the house.
- In Front Of: Facing the house.

Example: Shadow jumped over the fence.`
