  content: `### No Preposition Needed
English has "Zero Preposition" zones where adding a word makes the sentence repetitive or incorrect.

#### 1. The Logic of Home
When "Home" is a destination for movement, omit the preposition.
Example: Aayu walked home (NOT: to home).
Example: Arrive home (NOT: at home).

#### 2. Time Modifiers
Cancel the preposition when using: Today, Tomorrow, Yesterday, Next, Last, Every, This, That.
- This: I worked this morning (NOT: in this morning).
- Last: We met last year (NOT: in last year).
- Every: I study every day.

#### 3. Built-in Verbs
Some verbs are transitive and need no extra glue.
- Discuss: Discuss the plan (NOT: discuss about).
- Contact: Contact me.
- Visit: Visit the barn.

> Exception: Use "at home" for location (static), but "go home" for movement.`
