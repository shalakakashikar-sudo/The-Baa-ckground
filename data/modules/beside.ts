One extra letter completely changes the logic of these two words. One is about space; the other is about addition.

Beside describes physical proximity. It means the side of something is near you.
- Meaning: Physical location next to something.

Example: Aayu sits beside the tree.

#### 2. BESIDES (In Addition)
Besides is logical. It means "as well as" or "extra."
