One of the hardest parts of English is choosing between At and In for buildings. The rule depends on your intention. Are you there for the normal activity, or just inside the walls?



#### AT (The Purpose)
Use At when you focus on the activity or function of the place. You are there to do what people normally do there.
- At school: You are there to study.
- At the cinema: You are watching a movie.
- At work: You are doing your job.
- At the table: You are eating or working.

#### IN (The Container)
Use In when you focus on the physical building or 3D space. You are strictly highlighting that you are inside the walls.
- In the school: You are physically inside the building (maybe hiding from the rain).
- In the cinema: You are inside the lobby, perhaps buying tickets.
- In the office: You are inside the room (as opposed to being outside).

#### The Address Zoom
The preposition changes as you zoom in closer to the house.

- General (In): Use In for the city or country.
Example: I live in London.
- Specific (On): Use On for the street name.
Example: I live on Shadow Lane.
- Exact (At): Use At for the house number.
Example: I live at 12 Shadow Lane.

> ⚠️ The "Home" Exception:
We say "at home" or "at work." We never say "in home" or "at the home" in this context. It is a fixed phrase that indicates you are where you belong.`
